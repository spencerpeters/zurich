Today I found out that you can go along the water all the way from the Locust Beach trailhead to the BTC dog park! You have to clamber over a lot of rocks, but there's some crazy stuff down there--little driftwood houses, an abandoned boat hulk covered with graffiti, a little concrete building that's fallen into ruin... Also, the rock clambering is great fun.

Before that, I went over Joe's proposed construction for our soundness proof, and it was the same as our broken original one! We're going in circles. I tried to hammer out a different idea, and it worked--it "preserved coherence" and served as a counterexample to the premise of our inference rule. BUT it did not preserve number of solutions. Aargh. Of course I realized that after I'd written the whole thing up. I took a break (Locust Beach!) came back and tried to fix it, with no luck. Wrote an email to Joe.

Delicious pizza for dinner, some fun, not-so-everything-is-broken conversation. Edaleen's ice cream is way way better than say, Dreyers. Very weird. Watched Parasyte and a terrific episode of The Office where Dwight sets up a traditional southwest German Christmas party. Dad pulled up a cool new email service called Hey. It looks awesome, but no 2 minute hype video. Might have to try it...

Wrote this log and hit the hay.
