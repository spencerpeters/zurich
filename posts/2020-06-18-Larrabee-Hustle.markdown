Man, these days aren't so packed compared to other parts of my life, but they still feel pretty crazy. Exhausted so just a short summary.

Prepped for meeting with James with Sid and Artur. Did some reading, set up some little simulations, did some thinking over lunch while alternating toasting two halves of a pizza bagel.

Meeting was interesting. Didn't go quite as planned--I'd set up a nice agenda but we didn't really follow it. Sid's big picture takeaways seemed to be: law is complicated, we're not legal people, we should stick to the math, and hey, it doesn't sound like our naive model of precedent is *totally* wrong. I still think there's an important math / cs theory question here (if it hasn't been addressed yet).

Went on bike ride to Larrabee. The section along Chuckanut was pretty hilly and I pushed myself pretty hard--I was totally gassed by the time I got there. Had to slow it down a bit on the way back. Stunningly beautiful though! Crazy patterns of shade and sunlight on the road. Looks like there are campers at Larrabee--maybe Brandon and I could hang out there for a few days. Played another game of 1on1 with sis Iz, won 7-6 (narrowly!)

Amazing bratwurst dinner at home. Forget how good those are. Need to add to my stable rotation.

Had another long, perspective-shifting conversation after dinner. Watched our Parasyte and the Office. 1am--latest I've been up for at least a month. Crazy.
