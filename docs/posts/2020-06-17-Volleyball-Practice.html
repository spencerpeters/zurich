        <p>Highlights: Dad’s Smalltalk parser effort is stuck. Unfortunately, the cute graphical syntax given on the back of the “Blue Book” is just cute–it’s not easily convertable into a parser.</p>
<p>Looks like new renters will move into Farm St. early and take advantage of my vacancy–that’s kinda cool. I should be able to move my stuff into Lake St. early also. Excited to live in Lake St–it’ll be fun hanging out with Kiran and Stanley.</p>
<p>For fun looked up Joe’s papers and grad students from the last 5 years. It’s amazing what a variety of topics they cover. Interestingly, Joe’s written a ton of papers with professors from other universities, not involving any of his current grad students. That guy has surplus! Looked up some old grad students who ended up as profs or working as industry researchers. Also found out one of Joe’s students (a really bright guy!) is currently a 7th year. I gotta buy that guy coffee sometime and get his grad school story.</p>
<p>Got a really nice email from James Grimmelmann of Cornell Tech, describing roughly how precedents are used in case law, and how it differs from our naive k-nearest-neighbors model. He’s curious what we’ve read so far (about law, not much!) Hopefully we’re meeting him tomorrow. I put together an email explaining all of our thinking up to this point and what papers we have been reading, ran it by Sid and Artur and sent it out.</p>
<p>Went on a bike ride with sis I over to Bloedel Donovan Park, where we practiced on the sand volleyball courts. We were almost hoping to get into a pickup game, but nobody else was playing. We were doing pretty well though–I’m curious how we’d fare in competition. On the way back we went to Lafeen’s to grab some delicious donuts–glazed for Mom, pinwheel for sis Iz, and two maple buttermilks for me and Dad. #gratitude</p>
<p>Usual rest of the day–tasty leftovers for dinner, shot some hoops, took a little walk, oh yeah, sis Iz and I played some one on one and she beat me 7-4! :0 Her two free throws after I smacked her in the face on the up and under put it away… This will not be the final word on the matter. Read more of the Simons bio, watched our usual Parasyte and the Office, wrote this log and hit it.</p>
