        <h2 id="martins-theses">Martin’s Theses</h2>
<p>Went back from Quantum Information with Martin, excitedly discussing the day’s developments. We were expressing stochastic transition matrices as “superpositions” of deterministic computations. We had a complicated formula for doing so, and on the bus ride back correctly interpreted and tested it :D Also Martin is convinced that banking with fiat currency is a scam since more irreplaceable money returns to the bank than is created by it at the beginning of the loan ;P</p>
<h2 id="bouncing-betties">Bouncing Betties</h2>
<p>Later that day, go to a big, Erstsemester or FirstSemester party at Hönggerberg (or the Höng, as the cool kids say). Lots of random dancing, hang out with Betty a lot. Decide to leave early for sleep and head back with Betty. More good conversation–run into a seemingly sketchy yokel on the way back, who turns out to be a nice fellow and tells us the story of how he tried to bring his girlfriend food for the night shift but couldn’t get inside her workplace until 1am.</p>
